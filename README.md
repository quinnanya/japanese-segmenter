# japanese-segmenter
A Jupyter notebook for segmenting Japanese text, meant for people with little or no Python experience.

If you're comfortable with Python, you can just use the [RakutenMA Python module](https://github.com/ikegami-yukino/rakutenma-python).

To test out how well RakutenMA does on segmenting your text before you go through the trouble of setting up Jupyter notebooks, you can [use the web-based interface for RakutenMA here](http://rakuten-nlp.github.io/rakutenma/) -- which also does part-of-speech tagging.
